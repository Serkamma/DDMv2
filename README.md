Document management system designed to work with scanned documents (also called digital
archives). It extracts text from your scans using OCR, indexes them, and
prepares them for full text search. 

It supports PDF, TIFF, JPEG and PNG document file formats. 

This is web-based software. This means there is no executable file (aka no
.exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web
browser.
